# East Bay Parks and Gardens Map

This map uses the 

- Knockout.js framework,

- Google Maps Javascript API, and 

- Google Places Library 

...to display details for regional parks and gardens in the East Bay Area. 

To demo the project, download the repo and edit the index.html, replacing "YOUR_API_KEY" with your Google Maps API key which you can get [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

...This is a work in progress...
